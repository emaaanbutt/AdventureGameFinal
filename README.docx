Ah, I see you’ve wandered far into the castle. Few have found me, and fewer have left with their minds intact. 
Tell me, adventurer, are you one who seeks answers or more puzzles to tangle your thoughts?

(Option 1): "I seek answers. Tell me who you are and what you want."
(Option 2): "I enjoy a good challenge. What puzzle do you have for me?"
Choose your option : 1

BODYLESS:
Answers? Oh, answers, I have many. I was once a servant of this castle. But long ago, I angered the wrong master, and my body was taken as punishment. 
Now, I remain only as this... a whisper in the shadows. He sighs.
But since you want answers, listen closely. Somewhere in this room lies a key. But only those who are sharp of mind may claim it.

Ah! You stupid, useless creature. I hope you remain stuck within thee walls forever.

"Nothing in this castle comes for free, especially not from me. You must prove your wit to earn the key. Solve this, and the prize is yours. 
Fail, and you’ll remain here, wondering what could have been. (Bodyless gives a wicked laugh)"

I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?

Enter command : use cell key
Zenitsu! you have used the cell key to enter the Dungeon.

Enter command : look
As you descend into the dungeon, a chill envelops you, and the air is thick with an earthy smell. The flickering torches cast dancing shadows
 along the stone walls. Ahead, you see a dimly lit chamber where five pressure plates are arranged in a line, each etched with a different symbol. 
Maybe some sort of puzzle...

goblet

The exits are : 
Servant_Quarters(East)

an anvil, 
a feather, 
a stone,

skull.

These items maybe present in different rooms across the castle. (Eg type "use anvil" to use anvil)
Anvil (Heavy)
Enter your answer (type 'back' to go back): use anvil

Feather (Light)
Enter your answer (type 'back' to go back): use feather
You place the feather on the plate with the feather symbol. The plate sinks slightly into the floor with a soft click. It seems you’ve chosen wisely, but the puzzle isn’t complete yet.
Stone (Medium)
Enter your answer (type 'back' to go back): use stone
You place the stone on the plate marked with its symbol. The plate shifts slightly downward with a dull grinding sound. You sense you’re on the right path, 
but the puzzle remains incomplete.
Goblet (Medium)
Enter your answer (type 'back' to go back): use goblet
As you place the goblet on the corresponding plate, it lowers smoothly into the floor with a metallic clink. The tension in the air grows, 
as though something important is about to happen.
Skull (Heavy)
Enter your answer (type 'back' to go back): use skull
As you place the skull onto the last plate, it sinks down with a heavy thud. The room falls eerily silent for a moment before a soft click echoes 
through the chamber.

Mortal, you dare disturb my slumber in search of the key? Very well. But only those with a mind sharper than my claws may proceed. Your trial begins now.

mind for just a few fleeting moments. Then, as quickly as they appear, they will vanish, leaving only faint after-images in the darkness.
