save_game(): This function is responsible for saving the current progress of the game. 
It stores the player's current room and inventory into a file named 'savefile.txt' 
and also saves the game's overall state (variables, settings, etc.) into a separate file 
called 'gameState.json'. Once the data is saved, it prints a message confirming that the 
game has been saved successfully. This allows players to resume from the same point in 
future sessions.

load_game(): This function loads the saved game data from the previous session. 
It reads the 'savefile.txt' to retrieve the player's room and inventory, and reads 
'gameState.json' to restore the overall game state. If a saved file exists, it successfully 
restores the game to where the player left off. If no saved game is found, it notifies the 
player and starts a new game by calling the gameplay() function.

defaultState(): This function saves the game's default state, or the initial setup, into a 
file called 'defaultState.json'. This default state includes the starting values of various 
game variables and settings. By saving this data, the game can later be reset to its original 
condition if needed, providing a way to start fresh without losing the default configuration.

loadDefaultGame(): This function restores the game to its original state by loading data 
from the 'defaultState.json' file. This allows the player to reset the game to the default 
conditions, as though starting a new game from the beginning, preserving the initial setup 
of the game.*/
